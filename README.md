# gRPC vs. REST

## Abstract
In a world with an ever growing amount of Microservices, gRPC claims to be faster and more stable than REST. Microservices can be heavily dependant on eachother, which means speed and stability is key. When gRPC claims faster than REST, why isn't it the de facto standard? In this blog we will put gRPC and REST head to head, to see which is actually faster.

## Introduction

### Problem statement
*Is gRPC faster than REST*

## Hypothesis
*We will assume that gRPC is able to send and recieve requests faster than a tradiational REST.*

## REST
"Følgende blog har peget på fordele/ulemper ved x, vi vil undersøge følgende n"
### Pros

### Cons

### Sample project and metrics
_Should include how to reproduce for yourself_

## gRPC

### Pros

### Cons

### Sample project and metrics
_Should include how to reproduce for yourself_

## Conclusion
_Metrics comapred_
_When to gRPCS_
_When to REST_
